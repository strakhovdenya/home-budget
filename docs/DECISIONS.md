# Product decision log (from interview)

- D01: web app on Vercel, **not PWA**, responsive mobile and desktop.
- D02: user-entered actual card balance is main fact; intermittent updates are normal; optional individual transactions.
- D03: marking an obligation paid changes status/full reserve, NOT card balance; require fresh user-confirmed bank balance and warn if unchanged.
- D04: reserve the entire unpaid obligation; partial reserves explicitly **rejected**; partial payment may reduce outstanding.
- D05: savings are voluntary and adjustable, automatically roll forward; suggest release on deficit, never release automatically.
- D06: dynamic per-day guideline covers all discretionary purchases together; categories optional for later statistics.
- D07: distribute receipts and expenditures between past/current/future financial months, optionally split; bank date remains separate.
- D08: future-period income must not inflate current-month daily forecast; next-month preview divides by all days in next calendar month.
- D09: previous free cash automatically contributes to next month's daily guideline, retaining historical origin.
- D10: current-month budget can be negative; additional income/cash recharge/future allocation or savings release can cover deficit.
- D11: automatic start of month, manual review/close; close stores immutable original and revisions on later correction.
- D12: all financial changes and balances have history; late entry allowed; later observed balances are not overwritten.
- D13: regular payment templates propose creation upon start of new financial period or future-month income; user accepts/edits/skips.
- D14: PDF bank statements OPTIONAL, can be uploaded after close; proposal-based statement reconciliation without double debit.
- D15: v1 one bank card; later additional independent accounts/aggregate may be added. No cash ledger now.
- D16: one allowlisted user via Google OAuth; no public signup.
- D17: bank-like minimal UI built with MUI; light/dark/system; Russian/German/English.
- D18: change obligation amount with simple edit plus immutable event; separate paid vs cancelled, on cancellation release reserve to current free.
- D19: gentle stale checkpoint reminder after around 7 days, no mandatory daily tracking.
- D20: Codex in VS Code, Dark Factory-inspired **spec-first workflow**, not Claude-specific factory runtime.
